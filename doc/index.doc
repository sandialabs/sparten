   \mainpage SparTen: Software for Sparse Tensor Decompositions

   \section intro Introduction

SparTen is a standalone library of analysis tools for sparse tensor
applications.  It implements the following decomposition methods:
  - Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CPAPR)
    - Multiplicative Update (CPAPR-MU) [1]
    - Projected Quasi-Newton Row (CPAPR-PQNR) [2] 
    - Projected Damped-Newton Row (CPAPR-PDNR) [2] 

Sparten defines dense and sparse tensors, computes factorizations, and
provides input/output routines and example drivers.  The library is
designed to link with applications written by users.
